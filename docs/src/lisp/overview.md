# Lisp


"Lisp is outdated, Lisp is slow, Lisp has too many parentheses" &mdash; what excuses do people come
up with to once again resort to using clumsy mainstream scripting languages? While Lisp
dates back to the 1960s, its foundational ideas are so simple and general that they transcend the
concept of age, much like mathematics itself.

Parentheses? It might come as a surprise, but the number of parentheses in Lisp is comparable to
the number of parentheses (as well as brackets and braces) in other languages that lack significant
indentation. However, in Lisp, we gain a beautiful property: while editing and navigating code,
a programmer can operate on a syntax tree rather than individual characters and words. In fact,
in Lisp, every expression can be traversed with proper editor support &mdash; moving forward, backward,
to the parent, and to nested expressions, opposed to characters, words or in the best case type
definitions and functions in other languages. This level of structural clarity and manipulation is a
testament to Lisp's elegant design and contributes to its expressiveness and flexibility.

And since we're in software engineering, let your curious mind enjoy something new and hopefully
rewarding, or at least look at how many smileys you can put at the end of a function with all these
closing parentheses!
