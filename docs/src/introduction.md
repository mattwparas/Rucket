# Introduction

Welcome to "The Steel Book" &mdash; a guide for a dynamic and versatile programming language
designed to harmonize with Rust, known as Steel. Born from the Lisp family and descended from
Scheme, Steel offers a blend of dynamic expressiveness within Rust's strict environment, creating a
powerful synergy.

But why choose a Lisp dialect as an extension language?

Rust provides robustness and safety, ensuring reliable and efficient software development. However,
its rigidity can sometimes feel limiting when facing dynamic and evolving requirements, such as
those encountered in a text editor, a crucial tool that developers tailor to their needs. Enter
Lisp &mdash; a language family renowned for its extensibility and dynamic nature. It serves as the
ultimate extension language, designed to be extendable itself by allowing developers to create DSLs
and tweak the evaluation process to fit any domain or task, even those unforeseen or irrelevant to
the original application.

In "The Steel Book," our aim is twofold: to demystify language basics for developers unfamiliar
with Scheme intricacies and to teach about Steel in particular. That said, no prior Scheme
experience is needed; we've got you covered.
