* Lower AST to another IR after macro expansion
* Remove syntax objects from bytecode - just mark it with an index instead
* Generalize syntax objects and tokens over strings - make interning strings easy


* don't lower to dense instructions until absolutely necessary
* interning can be done just in time -> have different versions of compiled code
  * Create better packaged programs, including as much information as possible regarding the symbols being used, and when hooking up to an engine, add an optional verification step to confirm that the generated bytecode is in fact able to be run
* Add timing information + comments everywhere, make it easier to improve the codebase

* Break parser into its own crate
* Break compiler into its own crate (if possible)
* Separating the crates and documenting them will make it easier to work on them


* Make actual command line client -> try to abstract away the various parts and make it reasonable to interact with
  * use clap for argument parsing, interact with the API 

* Add syntax object metadata pass -> include scope information, be able to query with this information at macro expansion time (see Racket docs for information about this, but something like `free-identifier?`)

* Clean up warnings overall
